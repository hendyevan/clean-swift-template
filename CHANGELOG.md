## 1.0.0

Original template projects by Raymond Law and Miguel Berrocal were reworked. Extra protocols were removed to make templates be closer to original Clean architecture concept.

- Added the Scene template to generate the following Clean Swift components:
	- View Controller
	- Interactor
	- Presenter
	- Router
	- Boundary Models
	- Configurator
	- Worker
	- Unit Test
- These components can also be generated individually.
